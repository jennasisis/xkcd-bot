Explain XKCD
============
To get the explanation of an XKCD, just pass in its number:

```javascript
var explainxkcd = require("explainxkcd");
var comicNumber = 512;
explainxkcd(comicNumber, function(explanation) {
    console.log(explanation);
})
```

Or pass in several numbers:
```javascript
var explainxkcd = require("explainxkcd");
comicNumbers = [12, 455, 199, 1513];
explainxkcd(comicNumbers, function(explanation) {
    console.log(explanation);
})
```
And the callback will be run for each comic separately.
